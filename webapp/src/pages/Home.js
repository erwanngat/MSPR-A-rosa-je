          The company "Arosa-je" helps individuals take care of their plants.Founded in 1984, it was initially made up of a small team of botanists in a single city and has now grown to over 1,500 botanists across France. They provide services to plant owners in two ways:
          By taking care of their plants when the owners are away.
          By giving maintenance advice to help owners take better and better care of their plants.
